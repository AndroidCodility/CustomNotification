# CustomNotification
Android application to show Simple Notification and Custom Notification using Kotlin Programming Language.

A [Notification](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications.html) is a message that Android displays outside your app's UI to provide the user with reminders, communication from other people, or other timely information from your app. Users can tap the notification to open your app or take an action directly from the notification.

Notifications are a powerful tool in the Android developer’s toolkit, helping to keep your users up-to-date on events that are happening inside your application, even when they’re not looking at your app directly. A well-timed and useful notification is also a great way to tempt the user into launching your application – particularly if they haven’t visited your app in a while!
